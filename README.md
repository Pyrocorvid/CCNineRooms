CrossCode Nine Rooms mod and Past Booster meta-mod

Nine Rooms mod adds a mini-dungeon using the nine maps that have been removed from CrossCode over the course of development. This is kept as close to the original experience as possible, with minor tweaks to remove cheese and save-breaking stuff. To access the mini-dungeon, look in Rookie Harbor where ther used to be an entrance.

The first 5 rooms are balanced to be very challenging at level 1, no items. The following rooms are balanced for late Autumn's Rise. There is an opportunity to teleport out at the end of room 5, if you want to try them as originally intended. Otherwise, teleporting is disabled, as it tends to seriously break things.

Past Booster meta-mod bumps every enemy to level 80, if you'd rather have a post-game suitable experience. I cannot guarantee that tier 3 arts won't break things.
